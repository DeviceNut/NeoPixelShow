# NeoPixelShow Library

Arduino library for controlling single-wire-based LED pixels (such as the WS2812B) and strips as can be found from Adafruit (www.adafruit.com) or other retailers.

This has been reduced to the bare minimum show() function, offloading all other functionality to the calling application code, for maximum flexibility.

It supports AVR and ARM processors used in standard Arduino modules, but NOT the ESP8266 or ESP32 processors.

After downloading, rename folder to 'NeoPixelShow' and install in the Arduino Libraries folder.
