# NeoPixelShow Library

Arduino library for controlling single-wire-based LED pixels (such as the WS2812B) and strips as can be found from Adafruit or other retailers.

This has been reduced to the bare minimum show() function, offloading all other functionality to the calling application code, for maximum flexibility and minimal code use.

It supports the AVR, ARM, and ESP32 processors, but not the ESP8266.

After downloading, rename folder to 'NeoPixelShow' and install in the Arduino Libraries folder.
